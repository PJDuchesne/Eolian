; Test Case: Jump Testing
; This test case is for the first pass of the assembler
; The first pass should have an error for the lines specified
; Written by Tom Smith

; The following lines should NOT give an error within the first pass

Label	jne	Label	;test relative addressing
	jeq	Label2	;test forward referencing
	JNZ	&Label	;test absolute addressing
Label2	JZ	#Label	;test immediate addressing
	Jmp	#1	;test immediate addressing
	Jhs	#$1	;test immediate	addressing
	Jl	#-1	;??? I think this is allowed because -1 is just going to underflow

;The following lines should give an error

	jne	r1	;registers can not be jumped to
	jmp	Label(r1)	;indexed is not allowed for jumps
	jmp		;no operand should give an error
	jlo	@r1	;indirect is not allowed
	jl	@r9+	;indirect post increment also not allowed
